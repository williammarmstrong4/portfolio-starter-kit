## How Google Detects Fake Reviews?

Google detects patterns when users post similar reviews for different businesses, especially across distant locations. These can lead to flagged accounts or removed reviews.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

Google uses smart algorithms to identify fake reviews. These systems scan for unusual patterns or signs of inauthentic activity.

### Flagging Unnatural Behavior

If a business receives too many reviews at once or identical wording appears frequently, Google may investigate their legitimacy.

### Location Data Cross-checking

Google uses the reviewer’s phone location to verify if they were actually near the business. If not, the review may be removed.

### Review Patterns Across Businesses

Posting similar reviews for different businesses can lead to account flagging and review removal.
